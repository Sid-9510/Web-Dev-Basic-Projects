                <h2>B. R. Ambedkar</h2>
                <p> <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956)</b> was an Indian jurist, economist,
                    social reformer and statesman who chaired the committee that drafted the Constitution of India based
                    on the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India and the first draft of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau.
                    Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru. He later
                    renounced Hinduism, converted to Buddhism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement.After graduating
                    from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University
                    and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was
                    among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also
                    trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and
                    lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and
                    negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for
                    Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to
                    Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.</p>
